# Cloud Platform : OneDrive
# Application : Client-Side Web Education Platform for implementing from offline to online easily
# Why OneDrive?
# OneDrive is a basically free cloud storage with 25GB in each account, and it is very easy to manage this cloud system for users, like uploading program, and making folders
#We are making a platform that if you have a microsoft account and register OneDrive, you can make a MOOC/e-learning course with just this web script, and a online web page hosting system.
#Usually, if making  MOOCs/e-learning, you have to manage the file online, and it needs lental-server/cloud. Managing server/cloud is very difficult for educators, and also registering lental-server/cloud is costing. 
#However, this can manage cloud storage basically free by using the OneDrive storage. We have tools to visualize the file in the storage like app stores, and MOOC Edx/Coursea courses. 
#Also not just your cloud storage, we can use the user's OneDrive cloud storageto your web education platform, so you can host your web education platform with no cost even if the users of the web education platform increase.
